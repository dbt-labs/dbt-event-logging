Requires dbt >= 0.12.2

This package provides out-of-the-box functionality to log events for all dbt invocations, including run start, run end, model start, and model end. It outputs all data and models to schema `logging`. This fork ONLY outputs log information in prod (`target.name == 'prod'`).

There are three convenience models to make it easier to parse the event log data.

### Setup

1. Include this package in your `packages.yml`.
2. Include the following in your `dbt_project.yml` directly within your `models:` directive (making sure to handle indenting appropriately):

```YAML
pre-hook: "{{ logging.log_model_target_start_event() }}"
post-hook: "{{ logging.log_model_target_end_event() }}"
```

That's it! You'll now have a stream of events for all dbt invocations in your warehouse.

### Adapter support

This package is currently compatible with dbt's Snowflake, Redshift, and Postgres integrations.
